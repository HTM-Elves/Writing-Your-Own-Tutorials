The first page is complete. Now you need to create a second page for [the mini tutorial](https://htm-elves.github.io/Using-CSS-Counters/#the-solution){target="htm-elves"}.

## Starting a new page

1. Create a new file in the `Using-CSS-Counters/docs/md` folder, and call it `02-The-Solution.md`
2. In the empty file, type `sss` and press the Tab key five times, just like you did in section [4. Framing the Problem](#framing-the-problem), to create a `<section>` element for the new page. 

<details class="tip" open>
<summary>Create a section for every Markdown file</summary>
Remember to create a new section in this way for every Markdown file that you add to your tutorial. Any file which does not have a section with this format may not appear in the correct order and will not have its own entry in the menu.

And remember to press the Tab key at least twice: once to insert the `<section>` snippet, and once to transform the values for `id`, `aria-labelledby` and `href`.

</details>
