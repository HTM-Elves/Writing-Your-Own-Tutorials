This is the second article about using the HTM-Elves workflow to write your own tutorials. I am assuming that you have already read [Getting Started with HTM-Elves](https://htm-elves.github.io/Getting-Started), and that you have already:

- [x] Create your own GitHub Organization where you can publish tutorials
- [x] Forked the HTM-Elves repository, to use as the root of your tutorial   organization
- [x] Published your forked repository
- [x] Cloned your fork of the HTM-Elves repository to your local computer
- [x] Installed Pandoc and Watchman and a set of Node modules
- [x] Used HTM-Elves to generate a Demo tutorial 
- [x] Published the Demo tutorial in your GitHub tutorial organization.

If not, read [Getting Started with HTM-Elves](https://htm-elves.github.io/Getting-Started) first, and follow the instructions step-by-step.

<summary>All your own work?</summary>
You probably already have a clear idea about the first tutorial you want to write, but I don't know what your idea is. For simplicity, I will follow my own idea, so the examples I give will be generic. Please feel free to use your own content rather than the text, code and images that I provide.

<details class="pivot" open>
<summary>An Organization by any other name...</summary>
I'll imagine that you created a GitHub Organization called `MyTutorials`, and that you have created a folder called `MyTutorials`, into which you have cloned a fork of HTM-Elves, named `MyTutorials.github.io`. In the text that follows, please use your own folder name and repository name instead.
