As you may have noticed, I like to include coloured blocks which you can collapse and ignore if you are in a hurry. These are handled by HTML `<details>` elements. The icons they use can be found in `MyTutorials.github.io/public/svg/`.

To create one, type the Markdown prefix `ddd` (for **d**etails). You'll be asked to choose one of the following styles:

## Styling
The colours for the `<details>` elements are defined in the `:root` section of `MyTutorials.github.io/public/styles/`.

```css-#34
/* Details */
  --alert:     #800;
  --challenge: #609;
  --env:       #069;
  --note:      #040;
  --pivot:     #03c;
  --question:  #907;
  --solution:  #4069;
  --story:     #088;
  --tip:       #960;
  --tldr:      #004;
  --trouble:   #c60;
  --warn:      #630;
```

The `background-color`s are generated using the newly available `color-mix` functional notation:

```css-#702
  background-color: color-mix(
    in oklab,
    var(--bg-color),
    var(--darker)
  );
```

In older browsers, the backgrounds should just appear plain.
