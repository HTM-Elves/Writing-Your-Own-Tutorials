As you may have noticed, I like to include coloured blocks which you can collapse and ignore if you are in a hurry. These are handled by HTML `<details>` elements. The icons they use can be found in `MyTutorials.github.io/public/svg/`.

To create one, type the Markdown prefix `ddd` (for **d**etails). You'll be asked to choose one of the following styles:

## Styling
The "light" colors for the `<details>` elements are defined in the `:root` section of `MyTutorials.github.io/public/styles/`:

```css-#49
/* Details */
  --alert:     #f99;
  --challenge: #ecf;
  --env:       #aef;
  --feedback:  #beb;
  --note:      #dfd;
  --pivot:     #9cf;
  --question:  #fbd;
  --sandbox:   #fec;
  --solution:  #d9f6;
  --story:     #cfe;
  --tip:       #fe9;
  --tldr:      #77b;
  --trouble:   #fc9;
  --warn:      #fbb;
  --code:      #0001;
```

Colors for "dark" mode are defined a little lower down:

```css-#99
body:has(#theme-dark:checked) {
```
```css-s
/* lines skipped */
```
```css-#111
  /* Details */
  --alert:     #800;
```
```css-s
/* and so on... */
```



The `background-color`s are generated using the newly available `color-mix` functional notation:

```css-#867
  background-color: color-mix(
    in oklab,
    var(--bg-color),
    var(--darker)
  );
```

In older browsers, the backgrounds should just appear plain.
