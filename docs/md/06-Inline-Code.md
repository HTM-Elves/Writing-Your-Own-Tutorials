The next sentence in [the completed mini tutorial](https://htm-elves.github.io/Using-CSS-Counters/){target="htm-elves"} creates an inline `<code>` element around the `<ol>` tag. This is done using backticks (`` ` ``), like this:

```md-w
Imagine that you have an `<ol>` element with the following structure:
```

<summary>Showing backticks in text</summary>
Sometimes you might want to show a backtick as text, rather than using it to generate a `<code>` element. To do this, you need to place _double_ backticks before and after the single backtick that you want to show, with spaces around the single backtick, like this: ``` `` ` `` ```

To show the double backticks with the single backtick inside it in the last line, I had to enclose them all in _triple_ backticks, like this: ```` ``` `` ` `` ``` ````. And to show _that_ string of backticks, I had to enclose all of them in quadruple backticks. And so on. You get the idea.
